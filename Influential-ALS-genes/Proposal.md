#Predicting influential ALS genes
Maria T Chavez 

#Specific Aims 
  *Compile a set of ALS genes 
  *On gene networks, calculate a measure of influence 

#Background

Candidate gene prioritization is the process of ranking genes based on how likely it is that they are associated with a disease. Most candidate gene prioritization methods use a list of seed genes to rank the other genes. Genes that are ranked highly are likely to be associated with the disease. 

#Experiment Design and Methods 

##Compile a set of ALS genes
Use literature search 

##On gene networks, calculate a measure of influence 
	
On gene networks (protein-protein interactions, coexpression)  use seed genes to initiate a pagerank, which would, starting from the seed genes, calculate a measure of influence for each gene. 
See if any genes were ranked highly that were not in the list of seed genes
